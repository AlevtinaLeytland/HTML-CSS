## Homework HTML/CSS/GIT Week 3

## Todo list

1. Practice the concepts
2. GIT exercise: `animals` repository
3. Code along
4. Optional: Practice using frameworks
5. Optional: CSS preprocessors
6. Final notes

### 1. Practice the concepts

We'll start the week off with some more GIT practice! Go through the following:

1. [Learn Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
2. [Learn Git Version Control (Scenario 1 - 4)](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)
3. [How to Use GIT and GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

### 2. GIT exercise: `animals` repository

> Tip: you can either use the CLI to make your git commands or use a GUI. The most used is [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) and it visualises what happens. VSCode also has an integrated Git activity tab that you can use

In this homework you'll be working with GIT and GitHub. Follow the steps to learn how to create a remote repository and work with it from your local machine:

1. Create a repository on GitHub, called `animals`
2. Clone the repository to your local machine, using the SSH URL
3. Locally, create a file called "zoo.txt". Include 3 animals found in a zoo
4. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Make sure the commit message is meaningful (ex. "created txt file with animal names")
5. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
6. Go back to your local repository and create a branch called `new-feature`

> Tip: in software, a "feature" is a technical term that points to any functionality that a user can derive benefit from. For example, Facebook has many features: the ability to make a profile, like a post, place comments, etc.

7. Inside the new branch, create a file called "pets.txt". Include 3 animals that could be a pet
8. Also, add 2 more animals to the "zoo.txt" file
9. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Again, make sure the commit message is meaningful
10. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
11. On GitHub, find out how to merge branch `new-feature` into `main`
12. Merge the branches
13. Switch back to branch `main`
14. Pull the changes from your remote repository to your local repository, verify that everything worked

### 3. Code along

In this code along you'll continue practicing your skill by building a fully responsive website:

> Tip: Use GIT and GitHub along the way to practice!

### 4. Optional: Practice using frameworks

Some people love using frameworks, others like being in full control of the CSS. This is a personal thing and also differs per company so there is no one way that the world works here. If you have time and are interested, then have a look at the following tutorials for the different frameworks:

#### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is probably the most used CSS framework if a framework is being used. Have a look at the following links to know how to use it:

- [Bootstrap 5 Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s)
- [Making a complete responsive website using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhllkjYYUVE)

#### Materialize

In this section you're going to get familiar with [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/), a CSS framework based on Material Design - a design language created by Google.

- [Materialize Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gGrbtvASEZSlFEYBnPkmff)
- [Build A Travel Agency Theme With Materialize CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaP3vO-vEsg)

### 5. Optional: CSS preprocessors

In the wild you may also encounter the following terms: Less, SCSS, Sass. These are CSS preprocessors that give you some extra functionality that the preprocessor will then convert to the actual CSS file. You can, for example, create certain blocks of css code (mixins) that you can then use in multiple places. Allowing you to make sure that if you change the css in that mixin it is changed everywhere automatically.

For more information, have a look at:

- [Sass vs SCSS vs Less: tutorial](https://marksheet.io/sass-scss-less.html)

### 6. Final notes

In this module and especially this last week we have bombarded you with a lot of different ways to create your styles. In the rest of the curriculum we will leave it up to you to decide what way you like to work. Per project that you do, think about how you want to manage your css. You can either:

- **Write the CSS yourself**. This will allow you to have full control over the styles enabling you to make any changes you want, but will probably take some more time initially to make sure everything works.
- **Use a CSS framework**. If you had time to go through the frameworks, you may decide that you want to use the speed that they offer and don't mind the loss of some customizability.
- **Use a CSS preprocessor**. If you had the time to try these out and like that they solve a couple of problems you have writing the CSS yourself then use these. They require a little setting up though that could complicate things, so make sure you understand how that works.

You will always have to write some css yourself, but make sure to always choose only _one_ way of working per project, otherwise you are going to create a mess! If you are up for the challenge, then feel free to try different ways per project. It's always good to try different things!
