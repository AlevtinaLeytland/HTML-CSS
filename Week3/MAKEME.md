## Homework HTML/CSS/GIT Week 3

> Create a directory "week3" inside your `HYF-Module-HTMLCSSGIT` directory on GitHub. There should already be a "week1" and "week2" folder that contains your homework from the last 2 weeks.

## Todo list

1. GIT exercise: `animals` repository
2. CSS framework challenges
3. Code along
4. PROJECT: Responsive website

### 1. GIT exercises

#### `animals` repository

> Tip: make use of the CLI to practice your GIT skills. This not only teaches you how GIT works, but also how to work like a real software developer!

In this homework you'll be working with GIT and GitHub. Follow the steps to learn how to create a remote repository and work with it from your local machine:

1. Create a repository on GitHub, called `animals`
2. Clone the repository to your local machine, using SSH
3. Locally, create a file called "zoo.txt". Include 3 animals found in a zoo
4. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Make sure the commit message is meaningful (ex. "created txt file with animal names")
5. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
6. Go back to your local repository and create a branch called `new-feature`

> Tip: in software, a "feature" is a technical term that points to any functionality that a user can derive benefit from. For example, Facebook has many features: the ability to make a profile, like a post, place comments, etc.

7. Inside the new branch, create a file called "pets.txt". Include 3 animals that could be a pet
8. Also, add 2 more animals to the "zoo.txt" file
9. Add and commit the file to the local repository. Again, make sure the commit message is meaningful
10. Push your commit to the remote repository, verify that it has worked on GitHub
11. On GitHub, find out how to merge branch `new-feature` into `master`
12. Merge the branches
13. Switch back to branch `master`
14. Pull the changes from your remote repository to your local repository, verify that everything worked
