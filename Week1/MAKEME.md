# Homework HTML/CSS Week 1

## Todo list

1. Command Line Interface
2. CSS Challenges
3. Code along
4. PROJECT: Digital Resume

### 1. Command Line Interface challenge

> Before you start any of the exercises, make sure to create a folder on your desktop that will hold all of your exercise files. Give the folder the name `hyf-html-exercises`. Inside, create a `week1` folder and will hold this week's exercise files inside. 

Using the CLI, create a plain text file (`.txt`) that contains the commands necessary to answer the following questions:

1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like `/c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun`?
3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

```
first message
second message
```

### 2. CSS Challenges

In order to improve you need to practice a lot! In the following challenges you'll work with CSS, starting from the absolute basics to building a page:

### 3. Code along

A big part of learning web development is through learning by example. In the following video you'll learn how to build a simple website, using basic HTML & CSS:

### 4. PROJECT: Digital Resume

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

In the following assignment you'll make your own Digital Resume. Here are the requirements that need to be fulfilled:

-   It needs to be one webpage
-   Your project folder should contain two files: a `.html` and a `.css` file
-   Include the following pieces of information:
    -   Your personal information (Note: *the page will be public on the whole internet* for our review, so as a privacy-conscious individual, feel free to use fake information here)
    -   A picture of you
    -   A few lines about who you are
    -   Education (list at least 1 education institute)
    -   Work experience (list at least 1 workplace)

When writing the HTML include the following:

-   Different types of headings, like `<h1>` and `<h2>`
-   An unordered list (`<ul>`). Use this to list out your educational background
-   Another unordered list (`<ul>`).
-   An `<img>` tag (for your picture)
-   Some `<p>` tags

When writing the CSS include the following:

-   Some CSS properties, like: `margin`, `padding`, `color`, etc.
-   You are **NOT** allowed to use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, etc.)
-   Bonus: look into using [flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) or [grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFafSYg-PkI)

## SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!

After you've finished your todo list it's time to show us what you got! The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. The CLI challenge
2. The Digital Resume

Upload both in a repository to GitHub and then upload the link to it on the Trello board: "Feedback Assignments". Go through the [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to learn how to do this.
